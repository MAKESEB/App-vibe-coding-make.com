# Make App Development Master Guide

## Overview

This documentation collection contains comprehensive guides for building Make.com integrations with extensive examples extracted from real-world implementations. Each guide is designed to provide practical knowledge for developing Make apps with LLMs.

## Documentation Structure

### Essential Reading
- **00-LLM-DEVELOPMENT-RULES.md** - ⚠️ **START HERE**: Critical rules and common deployment issues
- **01-OVERVIEW.md** - This file: overview and navigation
- **02-FOLDER-STRUCTURE.md** - Standard Make app folder structure
- **03-ESSENTIAL-FILES.md** - Core files every Make app needs

> 💡 **Note**: The **00-LLM-DEVELOPMENT-RULES.md** file addresses many common development and deployment issues, including connection upload failures, SDK limitations, and critical configuration mistakes. Review this first to avoid known pitfalls.

### Configuration Guides
- **04-BASE-CONFIG.md** - Global app configuration patterns
- **05-METADATA-CONFIG.md** - App metadata and settings
- **06-CONNECTION-TYPES.md** - Authentication patterns (OAuth, API Key, etc.)

### Module Development
- **07-MODULE-PATTERNS.md** - Action, trigger, and search module patterns
- **08-PARAMETER-TYPES.md** - Input/output parameter definitions
- **09-API-CONFIGURATIONS.md** - API call patterns and techniques

### Advanced Features
- **10-RPC-PATTERNS.md** - Remote procedure calls for dynamic data
- **11-FUNCTION-DEVELOPMENT.md** - Custom JavaScript functions
- **12-WEBHOOK-CONFIGURATION.md** - Webhook setup and management

### Real-World Examples
- **13-AUTHENTICATION-EXAMPLES.md** - Complete auth implementations
- **14-MODULE-EXAMPLES.md** - Complete module implementations
- **15-API-PATTERNS.md** - Complex API integration patterns

### Best Practices
- **16-ERROR-HANDLING.md** - Error handling patterns
- **17-SECURITY-PRACTICES.md** - Security considerations
- **18-TESTING-DEBUGGING.md** - Testing and debugging approaches

### LLM Development
- **19-LLM-DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md** - LLM-specific development tips
- **20-COMMON-PATTERNS.md** - Reusable patterns and snippets
- **21-TROUBLESHOOTING.md** - Common issues and solutions
- **22-CONNECTION-UPLOAD-LEARNINGS.md** - Critical connection & deployment issue solutions

## Usage

Each file is designed to be:
- **Self-contained**: Can be read independently
- **Example-rich**: Filled with real-world anonymized examples
- **LLM-friendly**: Structured for AI consumption and generation
- **Practical**: Focused on implementation rather than theory

## Getting Started

1. Start with **02-FOLDER-STRUCTURE.md** to understand the basic layout
2. Review **03-ESSENTIAL-FILES.md** for must-have files
3. Choose your authentication method from **06-CONNECTION-TYPES.md**
4. Build modules using patterns from **07-MODULE-PATTERNS.md**
5. Refer to specific guides as needed for advanced features

## Example App Types Covered

This documentation covers patterns from:
- **API Integrations**: REST APIs, GraphQL, webhooks
- **Authentication Types**: OAuth2, API keys, basic auth, custom auth
- **Module Types**: Actions, triggers, searches, RPCs
- **Data Handling**: JSON, XML, file uploads, pagination
- **Error Handling**: Rate limiting, authentication errors, API errors

## Contributing

When adding new patterns or examples:
1. Anonymize all sensitive data
2. Include complete, working examples
3. Explain the "why" behind each pattern
4. Add error handling examples
5. Include testing approaches
